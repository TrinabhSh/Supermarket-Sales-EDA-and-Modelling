I have taken the most famous Supermarket Sales Dataset and tried to do an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to and visualise them. I've also fitted a linear regressor that takes an input and predicts the rating.

## Exploratory Data Analysis and Linear Regression on Supermarket Sales Dataset

![Supermarkets Offer More Store Brands to Lure Cost-Conscious Shoppers - WSJ](https://images.wsj.net/im-684613?width=1280&size=1.33333333)

The dataset is useful for performing a wide range of analyses, including sales trend analysis, customer segmentation, and product performance analysis. For example, the dataset can be used to determine which products are selling the most, which payment methods are the most popular among customers, or which branch or city has the highest sales volume.

## Supermarket Sales Data

-   **Invoice ID:**  A unique identifier for each sales transaction.
-   **Branch:**  The branch or location of the supermarket where the transaction took place.
-   **City:**  The city where the branch is located.
-   **Customer type:**  The type of customer who made the purchase, such as member or normal.
-   **Gender:**  The gender of the customer who made the purchase.
-   **Product line:**  The category of the product that was purchased.
-   **Unit price:**  The price per unit of the product.
-   **Quantity:**  The quantity of the product that was purchased.
-   **Tax 5%:**  The amount of tax (5% of the total price) charged on the purchase.
-   **Total:**  The total amount paid by the customer, including tax.
-   **Date:**  The date of the transaction.
-   **Time:**  The time of the transaction.
-   **Payment:**  The payment method used by the customer.
-   **COGS:**  Cost of goods sold, which is the amount paid by the supermarket for the products sold.
-   **Gross margin percentage:**  The gross margin percentage for the product sold.
-   **Gross income:**  The gross income generated by the sale.
-   **Rating:**  The customer rating for the supermarket, on a scale of 1-10.

## We will structure the code as follows

1.  Loading the data
    
2.  Preparing the data
    
3.  Exploratory Data Analysis
    
4.  Building the model and accuracy analysis
    
5.  Final Analysis of the model
    

## These are some of the insights

-   On average, the tax rate is 5% and the gross margin percentage is 4.76%
-   The sales volume for different product lines varies widely. For example, the Fashion Accessories product line has the highest sales volume, followed by Food and Beverages, while Health and Beauty has the lowest sales volume.
-   Although there is an almost equal distribution of male and female customers, there are slight differences in their purchasing behavior. For example, male customers tend to spend more on Electronic Accessories and Sports and Travel products, while female customers tend to spend more on Fashion Accessories and Health and Beauty products.
-   The most common payment method used by customers is e-wallet, followed by credit card and cash.
-   There are differences in sales volume across the three branches of the supermarket, with Branch A having the highest number of transactions and Branch C having the lowest.
-   The average customer rating for the supermarket is 6.97 out of 10, which is relatively high and suggests that customers are generally satisfied with their shopping experience.
-   On average, members spend more than non-members, suggesting that membership programs may be effective in increasing customer loyalty and sales.
-   Fashion Accessories products have the highest ratings, while Health and Beauty products have the lowest ratings.

**The above information can be useful for planning marketing and promotional campaigns and optimizing staffing and inventory levels during different times of the year.**
